# 🧪 Lab Work Details

## 🔹 Lab 01 – DBMS Basics
**Objective:**  
To understand basic DBMS concepts including:
- Introduction to DBMS  
- Advantages of DBMS  
- Data Models  
- Basic SQL Commands  

---

## 🔹 Lab 02 – College Database Creation
**Objective:**  
To understand **Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling** and convert it into **relational tables and SQL queries**.

In this lab:
- ER Diagram of College Database is designed  
- Entities like Student, Course, Faculty, Department are created  
- Tables are implemented using SQL  
- Primary & Foreign Keys are applied  

---

## 🔹 Lab 03 – Real-World Data Insertion
**Objective:**  
To understand real-world data collection and data insertion in a relational database using SQL.

In this lab:
- Real student/faculty/course data is collected  
- Data is inserted using INSERT statements  
- Constraints are validated  
- Practical SQL queries are executed  

---
## 🔹 Lab 04 – Data Retrieval Using SQL (Read-Only Queries)

**Objective:**  
To understand and practice retrieving and analyzing data from existing database tables using read-only SQL queries without modifying the database structure or stored data.

In this lab:
- Data is retrieved using SELECT statements  
- Column aliases are used for better readability  
- Records are filtered using WHERE clause  
- Results are sorted using ORDER BY  
- Limited rows are displayed using FETCH  
- Derived/computed columns are generated  
- Date and string functions are applied  
- Multiple tables are combined using JOIN  

### 📚 Concepts Practiced

- SELECT statement  
- Column Alias (AS)  
- WHERE clause  
- ORDER BY clause  
- FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY  
- Date functions (SYSDATE, EXTRACT, MONTHS_BETWEEN)  
- String functions (SUBSTR, INSTR)  
- JOIN operations  

### 🗂 Tables Used

- STUDENT  
- FACULTY  
- COURSE  
- ENROLLMENT  
- DEPARTMENT  

## 📌 Topics Covered
- DBMS Fundamentals  
- ER Model & Relational Model  
- Attributes & Keys  
- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)  
- SQL Commands (DDL, DML, DQL, TCL)  
- Joins & Subqueries  
- Constraints  
- Transactions

# 🔹 Lab 05 – Advanced SQL Queries & Constraints

## 📌 Objective
To understand and implement advanced SQL queries using joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and constraints in a relational database.

---

## 📖 Description
In this lab, we focus on writing complex SQL queries and applying constraints to maintain data integrity. This lab enhances practical understanding of how real-world databases handle relationships and validations.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Write INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
- Use GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Apply Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Write Subqueries
- Implement Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK)
- Perform advanced SELECT queries for real-world scenarios

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
